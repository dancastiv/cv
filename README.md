## Daniela Castilla

Hello! I am a freelance video editor hoping to pivot into software development. Though I am just starting my journey, I have been having the time of my life acquiring new skills, learning new technologies as I go, and working with knowledgeable and passionate people. I have always been meticulous, focused, and able to improvise, so it has been a very smooth transition into applying my creativity to code. I would love to continue my journey and I am looking to become a Junior Developer soon.
